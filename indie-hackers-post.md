**Title:** Launching HN Opportunity Radar — Never miss a business opportunity again

**Body:**

Hey IH,

I've spent the last 2 years scrolling Hacker News for 2 hours every morning, hunting for business opportunities.

Then I realized: this is stupid. I should automate it.

## What I built

HN Opportunity Radar scans HN 24/7, uses AI to analyze trends, and delivers actionable business opportunities to your inbox every morning.

**What you get:**
✅ Top 5 opportunities daily
✅ Revenue potential analysis  
✅ Specific "build this" recommendations
✅ Time saved: 30+ minutes/day

**Example from today:**
> "AI agent orchestration tools trending. Gap: No simple hosted solution for non-technical users. SaaS opportunity: $20-50/mo per user."

## Pricing

## Stack
